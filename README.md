# EchoSphere

**EchoSphere** is an immersive spatial audio app that lets users create dynamic 3D soundscapes using interactive orbs, offering a joyful and intuitive experience for relaxation and creativity. It leverages SpriteKit and SwiftUI for smooth animations, interactions, and a minimalist interface, solving the problem of static or uninspiring audio environments.

*Spatial audio uses 3D sound positioning to create an immersive listening experience, allowing users to craft personalized soundscapes by interacting with orbs that play sounds like birds, rain, or footsteps, enhanced by AirPods for optimal effect.*

### Swift Student Challenge

This app was developed for the Swift Student Challenge 2025 and is being submitted for consideration.

## Technologies

The playground uses:
- **SpriteKit** for 2D graphics, physics, animations, and particle effects, enabling smooth orb interactions and visual feedback.
- **AVFoundation** for spatial audio positioning, creating an immersive 3D audio experience, especially with AirPods.
- **SwiftUI** for a seamless and minimalist interface, enhancing user focus on the sound interaction.
- Developed and tested in **Swift Playgrounds** and **Xcode** to meet the Swift Student Challenge requirements.

## Future Plans

An App Store version of EchoSphere is planned, expanding its features to include more sound options, saveable soundscapes, and additional interaction modes for broader accessibility and engagement.
